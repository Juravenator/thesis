\chapter{Conclusion}
The main objective was to upgrade the TS to be able to provide more advanced
interfaces, and to keep compatibility with legacy interfaces.

The new interface engine has achieved 100\% backwards compatibility, while
providing a completely new way to develop new interfaces.

This new interface engine and can be easily extended and is ready for any future
use-cases as it is built to change. The developers are not bound to the
functionality of one framework, rather it is build on open standards and thus
ensures maximum compatibility with future technologies.

The interface developers now have internal, semi auto-generated, documentation
at their disposal and have an active community on the world wide web to fall
back to.
